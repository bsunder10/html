            <small style="color: gray">DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</small>
            <p>
                Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge,
                 and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, 
                 behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what 
                 stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, 
                 we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations
                 that *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments,
                  and companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your 
                  own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost 
                  impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.
            </p>

            <small style="color: gray">DEATH TO WIREFRAMES: LONG LIVE RAPID PROTOTYPING</small>
            <p>
                Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little better
                 by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions. 
                 Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster; it increases collaboration 
                 and improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.
